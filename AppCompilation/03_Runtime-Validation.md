## 03. Runtime Validation

The **Runtime Validation Process** ensures that the app functions correctly when executed in a simulated environment. This process involves **running the app on an emulator** and **verifying data flow** to ensure proper interaction with the database. Once the app is launched in the emulator, various user actions are simulated to test core functionalities. During this process, the database is actively monitored to confirm that data is being stored, retrieved, and updated correctly. By performing runtime validation, developers can catch potential issues related to app behavior and data flow before deploying the app to real devices.
