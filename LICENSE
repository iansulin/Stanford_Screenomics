IMPORTANT: The collection of participants’ screenomes provides a rich repository of digital life and new insights about how individuals engage with digital media in everyday life. These collections and data also require substantial consideration of a variety of privacy issues and protocols that support and maintain confidentiality. Those reviews included university faculty, administrators with extensive experience in research with human subjects, system engineers, and legal consultants that considered all the relevant consent, privacy protection, and legal and ethical issues. We continue to monitor and consider best practices of data security and privacy relevant to our project. Screenome data often contain highly personal or sensitive information, and we have designed our data collection and analysis protocol to maintain participants’ privacy to the best of our abilities.
