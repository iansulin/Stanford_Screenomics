## 03. Build Validation

The **Build Validation Process** ensures that the Screenomics app is correctly built, runs smoothly, and properly interacts with new databases. This process includes four key steps: **cleaning the project**, **building the app**, **running it on an emulator**, and **verifying data flow**. First, the project is cleaned and rebuilt in Android Studio to remove outdated files and compile fresh code. Next, the app is deployed on an emulator to simulate real device behavior. During this simulation, various features are tested to confirm proper functionality. Finally, the databases are monitored to ensure that all expected data is being recorded and retrieved correctly. This structured validation process helps detect issues early, ensuring a stable and reliable app before deployment.
