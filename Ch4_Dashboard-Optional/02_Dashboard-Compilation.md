## O4.02. Dashboard App Compilation

**Study Dashboard App** provides researchers with real-time, continuous monitoring of study participants by displaying activity summaries and detailed event logs fetched from Ticker, enabling effective tracking of engagement and data quality.

**Before you begin:**
* Compile your data collection app and complete Firebase setup to ensure **Ticker** is fully configured and ready to use [[Complete all sections in Chapter 2](../Ch2_App-Compilation/)].
* Ensure you have your `google-services.json` file ready. This file can be obtained from the the Firebase console for your project [[See Chapter 2 - Section 02.2.b](../Ch2_App-Compilation/02_Firebase-Setup.md)].
* A video instruction can be downloaded at: [02_Dashboard-Compilation_Video.mp4](../Ch4_Dashboard-Optional/02_Dashboard-Compilation_Video.mp4)

### 4.02.1. Download the Project from GitHub

a. **Download the Project**
   - https://github.com/iansulin/stanford_screenomics/releases/download/Source-Code/ScreenomicsDashboard_External_062025.zip

b. **Extract the ZIP File**
   - Locate the downloaded ZIP file and extract it to a folder of your choice.

---

### 4.02.2. Add the google-services.json File

a. **Launch Android Studio**
   - If you haven't opened it yet, start Android Studio.

b. **Open the Project**
   - Click on **Open**.
   - Navigate to the extracted project folder, select it and click **OK**.
     - If prompted, do **NOT** click on the **Sync Project with Gradle Files** yet.

c. **Locate "App" Module**
   - In the **Project View** (usually on the left), click the dropdown at the top and select **Android** to display the project structure.
   - Find the **app module** in the project view, which has **a folder icon with a green square**. 

d.  **Add the JSON File to the "App" Module**
   - Open the folder on your computer where the `google-services.json` file is located.
   - Copy the `google-services.json` file (`Command + C` or `Ctrl + C`).
   - In Android Studio, **Select the App Module** (the folder icon with a green square).
   - **Paste the JSON file into the "App" Module**.
   - If/When a "Copy" or "Replace" window appears, do **NOT** change any settings--simply click **OK**.

> * You **do not** need to refactor anything, and **do not** need to change the app name (unless you prefer to personalize it). This app is intended for **internal use only** and to be installed manually via APK distribution (not via Google Playstore). If you **do** want to change the app name, refer to: [Chapter 2.03.8 – Change App Name](../Ch2_App-Compilation/03_Android-Studio-Setup.md)

> * You **do not** need to configure or set up a new password—authentication. You can log in using the same credentials you created when registering for the Screenomics data collection app. The Dashboard App uses the same Firebase Authentication backend as the data collection app. All user authentication is managed centrally through Firebase, so once your account is registered for data collection, it can also be used to access the Dashboard App without additional setup. Make sure the data collection app is compiled and Firebase is fully set up **before** working on the dashboard app.

### 4.02.3. Clean and Build the Project

a. **Clean the Project**
   - Go to the menu bar and select **Build > Clean Project**
      - This will remove any previously compiled files and clean the project's output directories.

b. **Build the Project**
   - After cleaning, go to **Build > Rebuild Project**
      - This will compile all the files and create a new build of the project.
      
c. **Monitor the Build Output**
   - **Open the Build Output Window**
      - The **Build Output** window is usually located at the bottom of Android Studio.
      - If it’s not visible, go to **View > Tool Windows > Build **to open it.
   - Check **Build Messages**
      - In the Build Output window, you will see messages indicating the progress of the build process. Look for messages that say:
      - "**BUILD SUCCESSFUL**": This means your project has been built without any errors.
      - "**BUILD FAILED**": This indicates that there were errors during the build process. Check if any previous steps were missed or misconfigured.

### 4.02.4 Creating a Keystore

To securely sign your Dashboard App, you **must generate a new Keystore**. 
Do **NOT** reuse the Keystore from your data collection app, as each app should have its own signing credentials.

a. Create a Keystore
  - In Android Studio, go to Build in the top menu > select "**Generate Signed Bundle / APK**."
  - In the dialog that appears, select **APK** and click **Next**.
  - Click on the "**Create new....**" button.
  - Fill in the required fields
    - **Key store path**: Choose a location to save your keystore file.
    - **Password**: Set a password for the keystore.
    - **Key alias**: Enter a name (alias) for your key.
    - **Key password**: Set a password for the key (can be the same as the keystore password).
    - **Validity (years)**: Set for how many years the key will be valid (e.g., 25).
    - **Certificate information**: Fill in your name, organization, and other details.
  - Click **OK** to create and save the keystore.

### 4.02.5. Building a Signed APK

a. **Generate the Signed APK**
  - Select Your **Keystore**
    - In the `Generate Signed APK` dialog, select the keystore file you just created.
    - Enter the keystore password and the key alias/password you set earlier.
  - Select Build Variants
    - Choose the build variant (e.g., **release**) from the dropdown.
    - Click **Next**, review the settings, and then click **Finish**.
  - Locate the APK
    - Once the build is complete, a dialog box will appear in the bottom-right corner of Android Studio.
    - Click **Locate** to open the folder where the APK is saved.
      - Alternatively, manually navigate to the directory: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`

### 4.02.6 Sharing and Installeing the Signed APK

After generating the signed APK, you can share it with researchers, testers, or participants using one of the methods below. Additionally, follow these instructions to ensure successful installation on Android devices.

a. **Sharing the APK**
- Cloud Storage: Upload the APK to *Google Drive*, *Dropbox*, or *OneDrive*.
   - Share a secure link with your recipients, making sure to set appropriate access permissions.
- If you want a simple, no-sign-in-required way to share it, you can use file transfer services such as:
   - *WeTransfer*, *SendAnywhere*, *TransferXL*, or *Dropbox Transfer*.
   - These services usually keep files available for a limited time (e.g., 7 days), so be sure to notify recipients accordingly.
- Email: For small APK files (<25MB), you can email the APK, though **many email services block APK attachments**. Sharing a cloud storage link is usually more reliable.

b. **Installing the APK on Android Devices**
- For best results, recipients should download the APK directly on the Android device where it will be installed:
   - Open the shared link on the Android device’s browser.
   - Download the APK file to the device’s local storage.
- Before installing, enable installation from unknown sources:
   - **For Android 8.0 and above:** Go to Settings > Apps & notifications > Special app access > Install unknown apps, then allow the browser or file manager to install APKs.
   - **For earlier versions:** Go to Settings > Security, and enable Unknown sources.
- Open the downloaded APK file via the notification or using a file manager.
- Follow the prompts to install the app.
