##  Overview of Modular Architecture of The Stanford Screenomics

The Stanford Screenomics Data Collection App features a modular architecture that streamlines data collection across various device aspects, enabling developers to easily enable or disable functionalities for greater flexibility and scalability. It consists of two core base modules—`ModuleManager` and `DatabaseManager`—which provide the essential framework for the app’s operations and facilitate the integration of additional data collection modules. These base modules handle critical tasks like data structure management and database setup, creating a robust foundation that simplifies the development and integration of new modules. Developers can leverage existing functionalities from the base modules, ensuring their custom modules align seamlessly with the app’s architecture. Currently, the app includes nine built-in data collection modules, each tailored to specific needs and utilizing features from the base modules. This design encourages collaborative enhancements, allowing multiple developers to contribute to the evolution of the app by collectively updating the base modules, improving data collection methodologies, and reinforcing security measures. As a result, this modular setup not only enhances usability and adaptability but also positions the app to evolve efficiently with changing data collection requirements while maintaining a secure and robust environment.

The `ModuleManager` acts as the central control system for the app, overseeing the operational status of various data collection modules. It provides the necessary infrastructure to activate or deactivate features based on user preferences or system conditions, ensuring the app adapts to different contexts without compromising performance. This dynamic configuration allows for real-time adjustments to functionality, enabling developers to tailor the user experience to specific needs or constraints. Additionally, the `ModuleManager` ensures centralized event management by consistently timestamping all data collected across different modules, which is vital for accurate data analysis. It also centralizes the generation of characteristics for various events, such as location updates and battery state changes, ensuring uniformity in how events are defined and logged throughout the app. Furthermore, the `ModuleManager` maintains static flags that indicate whether specific data collection modules are enabled or disabled, promoting cohesive module coordination and preventing conflicts within the system.

The `Database Manager` is essential for data storage and retrieval, acting as the primary repository for all user-related data and preferences. This module provides a secure storage solution for sensitive information, such as user authentication data and communication preferences, ensuring that this information is well-protected yet accessible when needed. It offers robust data management options for both text-based data, like user location coordinates, and non-text-based data, such as screenshot images. Initially, all data is stored in a hidden local storage on the user's device. When connected to a network, text-based data is transferred to Firestore, while non-text-based data is sent to Google Cloud Storage. Developers can set network preferences for data transfer separately for text and non-text data; for instance, specifying Wi-Fi only for non-text data ensures uploads occur exclusively when connected to Wi-Fi. Additionally, the module regularly syncs data collected from various modules and manages the upload of events to maintain an up-to-date database of user interactions. It also tracks communication-related preferences, enabling modules to respond effectively to user needs and system conditions. For example, if a developer has set preferences based on device power states, the app can adjust its notification settings to ensure users receive timely alerts about inactivity. 

The data collection modules consist of eight distinct components, each responsible for gathering specific types of data based on user interactions or system events. The `screenshots` module captures and uploads screenshots automatically at defined intervals, providing a visual record of screen contents on a user device. The `apps` module monitors and logs the currently active applications, offering valuable insights into user engagement patterns. The `interactions` module records user actions, including clicks and scrolls, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of user behavior. The `locations` module manages continuous location updates, tracking the device's geographic position using latitude and longitude. The `activities` module logs step counts through the device's sensors, contributing to a better understanding of physical engagement. The `battery` module monitors battery status and logs related events, facilitating effective power usage management. The `power` module tracks screen state changes (on/off) to manage user presence and interaction, while the Network module monitors connectivity to Wi-Fi and data plans, logging changes to optimize data usage management. The 'specs' module collects basic device specifications upon account creation.
