<details> <summary>What is the [NO IMAGE] issue in the data, and how does it occur?</summary> <p> The "[NO IMAGE]" issue arises when the app struggles to process multiple screenshot requests simultaneously. Hereâ€™s how it happens: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Memory Overload:</strong> When a screenshot is captured, it temporarily stores a large amount of image data in memory before saving it. If another screenshot request is made before the first one finishes, memory usage spikes, potentially leading to slowdowns or crashes. </li> <li> <strong>Buffer Overload:</strong> The ImageReader component has a buffer to queue screenshot data. If the buffer fills up, new images are rejected until existing ones are processed. </li> <li> <strong>Concurrency Issues:</strong> To prevent multiple screenshots from being processed simultaneously, the app uses a locking mechanism (e.g., `imageReaderMutex.acquire()`). This ensures one image is handled at a time, preventing congestion. </li> <li> <strong>Storage Delays:</strong> Slow or insufficient storage can delay image saving, causing subsequent screenshot attempts to fail. </li> </ul> <p> The frequency of this issue varies by device specifications: </p> <ul> <li><strong>High-spec devices:</strong> Rarely experience "[NO IMAGE]" due to better memory, faster storage, and efficient processors.</li> <li><strong>Low-spec devices:</strong> More prone to issues due to slower processing, limited RAM, and storage constraints.</li> </ul> <p> <strong>How to mitigate it:</strong> </p> <ol> <li>Lower the sampling frequency to give the system more time to process each screenshot.</li> <li>Reduce image resolution or quality to minimize memory usage and speed up saving.</li> <li>Ensure sufficient available storage and memory before capturing screenshots.</li> </ol> <p> These optimizations reduce memory congestion, prevent buffer overflows, and improve overall system stability. </p> </details>
