## 03. Runtime Validation

The **Runtime Validation Process** ensures that the app functions correctly when executed in a simulated environment. This process involves **running the app on an emulator** and **verifying data flow** to ensure proper interaction with the database. Once the app is launched in the emulator, various user actions are simulated to test core functionalities. During this process, the database is actively monitored to confirm that data is being stored, retrieved, and updated correctly. By performing runtime validation, developers can catch potential issues related to app behavior and data flow before deploying the app to real devices.

### 03.1. Simulating the App in an Emulator

a. **Set Up an Emulator**
  - Click on the **Device Manager** icon in the toolbar (ðŸ“± it looks like a phone).
    - If the icon is not visible, go to **Tools > Device Manager**.
  - Click **Create Virtual Device**.
  - Choose a device from the list and click **Next**.
  - Select a system image (download it if prompted) and click **Next**.
  - Configure additional settings if needed, then click **Finish**.

b. **Run the App on the Emulator**
  - Start the **Emulator**
    - In Device Manager, find your created virtual device and click the green "Run â–¶" button (green triangle) or press `Shift + F10` to launch it.
  - Wait for the Emulator to Boot (it may take a few minutes to boot up for the first time).
  - Once the emulator is running, you can interact with your app as you would on a physical device.
    - Use your mouse to click, drag, and type.

### 03.2. Test Registration

a. Enter Registration Details
  - On the first launch of your app in the emulator, fill in the required fields:
    - Study Group Code
    - Participant ID
    - Email
    - Password

b. Submit the Form
  - Tap the Register button to submit the form.
  - Observe the appâ€™s behavior to ensure successful registration.
  
c. Check Firebase Console for User Registration
  - Go to **Firebase Console**
  - In your Firebase Console, click on **Build > Authentication** in the left sidebar
  - Click on the "**Users**" tab at the top of the Authentication section.
  - **Verify User Registration**
    - **Look for the newly registered user in the list**.
    - Ensure the email and other details match the registration input.
    - If the user does not appear, check for any errors in the app or Firebase setup.
  - **Repeat Testing**
    - If you need to test multiple registrations, you can either delete the user from the Firebase Console or use a different email each time.
