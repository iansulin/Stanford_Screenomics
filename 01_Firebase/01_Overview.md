## 01. Overview

The Stanford Screenomics system uses a **Firestore** NoSQL database for storing text-based data and **Google Cloud Storage** for non-text data, both compliant with HIPAA regulations. It utilizes **Firebase Authentication** to securely manage user sign-up, sign-in, and account management. Additionally, it integrates **Crashlytics** for real-time crash reporting and analytics, helping developers diagnose and resolve issues to improve app stability. All of these services are part of the **Firebase** ecosystem.

This document assumes a general familiarity with the goals and uses of the Stanford Screenomics app, as well understanding of how users are onboarded and how they interact with the app. This documentation is therefore most useful for those who aim to gain a better understanding of how Firebase ecosystem integrates with the app.
