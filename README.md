## Hey there!

You’ve probably heard about Stanford Screenomics, our open-source platform for collecting digital trace data from Android smartphones. If not, welcome — you’re in the right place!

Whether you're running a clinical study, building a behavioral surveillance app, or exploring behavioral patterns, Stanford Screenomics is here to help you get started — fast. It’s designed for researchers, developers, and anyone interested in studying everyday human behavior in the digital world and beyond—without needing to build an entire infrastructure from scratch.


What’s in this repo:
1. **Two project files** — a data collection app and a dashboard app — to help you build your own custom tools, tailored to your study, no coding required.
2. **Step-by-step instructions** — easy-to-follow guides to build and deploy both apps. For developers, we also include guidance on contributing new features or extending the platform to serve your project — or the public — even better.
3. **Comprehensive documentation** — detailing app features, the types of data collected, the data collection process, and the overall app architecture.
4. **FAQ section** - answers to common questions to help you troubleshoot and better understand the platform.
