### Crashlytics

The Stanford Screenomics utilize Firebase Crashlytics to efficiently notify developers of crashes. This mechanism enhances our ability to debug issues and provides a more streamlined approach to crash reporting.

When the app experiences a crash, Crashlytics automatically captures the event, eliminating the need for manual log creation. Crash reports are sent in real-time and include comprehensive information such as:
* **Timestamp**: The exact time when the crash occurred.
* **User Identifier**: A unique identifier for the user who experienced the crash (ensuring privacy and compliance with data regulations).
* **Logcat Dump**: A detailed log of the app's activities leading up to the crash, which is invaluable for debugging.
* **Stack Trace**: A complete stack trace of the crash, highlighting the code path that led to the failure.

In addition to crash reports, Crashlytics provides insights into non-fatal issues, allowing developers to track minor errors that may not terminate the app but still affect user experience.

The app maintains a "crashes" node in the database, which records any significant issues encountered by users. For each crash or significant error, an entry is created with relevant details, including:
* **App Crash**: When the app crashes and is terminated.
  * **Exception Class**: The type of Java exception that occurred.
  * **Exception Message**: A description of the exception.
* **Background Service Termination**: Android will occasionally kill off background services that have been running for a long time, and Screenomics is not exempt from this. If the Android system kills the Screenomics app, Crashlytics captures this event as well.
  * **Message**: A predefined message indicating that the service has been restarted (e.g., "MediaProjection was null on startupâ€¦").
  * **Tag**: Identifies the service affected (e.g., "CaptureUploadService").
These entries are generally benign and can be safely ignored, as the app automatically restarts itself, which is a normal part of its operation.

### Whitelist

There are several reasons why Android might kill the Screenomics app, and any apps with background services in general. 
* **Battery Optimazation**: Android devices often have aggressive battery-saving modes that restrict background activity for apps not deemed essential.
* **Memory Management**: When the device runs low on RAM, Android may terminate background apps to free up resources.

The Stanford Screenomics app has been implemented several strategies to minimize the risk of being killed by the system and maintain ongoing data collection, such as:
