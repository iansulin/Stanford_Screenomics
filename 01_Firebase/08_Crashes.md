## 08. Crashes

The Stanford Screenomics utilize Firebase Crashlytics to efficiently notify developers of crashes. This mechanism enhances our ability to debug issues and provides a more streamlined approach to crash reporting.

### 08.1. Crashlytics

When the app experiences a crash, Crashlytics automatically captures the event, eliminating the need for manual log creation. Crash reports are sent in real-time and include comprehensive information such as:
* **Timestamp**: The exact time when the crash occurred.
* **User Identifier**: A unique identifier for the user who experienced the crash (ensuring privacy and compliance with data regulations).
* **Logcat Dump**: A detailed log of the app's activities leading up to the crash, which is invaluable for debugging.
* **Stack Trace**: A complete stack trace of the crash, highlighting the code path that led to the failure.

In addition to crash reports, Crashlytics provides insights into non-fatal issues, allowing developers to track minor errors that may not terminate the app but still affect user experience.

The app maintains a "crashes" node in the database, which records any significant issues encountered by users. For each crash or significant error, an entry is created with relevant details, including:
* **App Crash**: When the app crashes and is terminated.
  * **Exception Class**: The type of Java exception that occurred.
  * **Exception Message**: A description of the exception.
* **Background Service Termination**: Android will occasionally kill off background services that have been running for a long time, and Screenomics is not exempt from this. If the Android system kills the Screenomics app, Crashlytics captures this event as well.
  * **Message**: A predefined message indicating that the service has been restarted (e.g., "MediaProjection was null on startupâ€¦").
  * **Tag**: Identifies the service affected (e.g., "CaptureUploadService").
These entries are generally benign and can be safely ignored, as the app automatically restarts itself, which is a normal part of its operation.

### 08.2 Ensuring Continuous Background Operation

The Screenomics app has implemented several strategies to minimize the risk of being killed by the system and to maintain ongoing data collection:

* **Battery Optimazation**: Android devices have aggressive battery-saving modes that restrict background activity for non-essential apps. To work efficiently with Doze mode, the app uses `setAndAllowWhileIdle()` instead of forcing immediate execution. Since some manufacturers impose even stricter background restrictions, Screenomics asks users to whitelist the app to help maintain continuous background operations.
* **Memory Management**: When a device runs low on RAM, Android may terminate background apps to free up resources. The Screenomics app proactively handles this by using `onTrimMemory()` to clear caches when the system is under memory pressure. Additionally, by using optimized data structures, the app further reduces memory usage, ensuring smoother performance and lower chances of being forcefully closed.
* **White List**: Some Android manufacturers implement aggressive app-killing policies that can interfere with background processes, even for apps explicitly optimized for efficiency. To mitigate this, the Screenomics app prompts users to whitelist it after completing registration. This step ensures that the app can run continuously in the background without interruption and improves data collection reliability.
